Introduction
------------

In order to benchmark the automatic navigation software a set of well defined test situations is required.
This document intends to provide these situations.

How to grade these benchmarks?

* Reaching goal
* Collisions
* Time
* Smoothness (subjective)

Simple Goal Benchmarks
----------

These benchmarks test the ability of the automatic navigation to navigate to a simple goal pose. 
A goal pose is a position and orientation. The ground is assumed to be flat and easy for the robot to drive on.
Obstacles can all, in theory be seen by the robot. (What to do in situations where the robot has to drive backwards and has no kinect for example?)

### Simple
### Replanning
### Unreachable goal
### Narrow passages
### L-shaped passages
### Narrow corridors
### Tight corners
### Large open spaces
### Open space with a single obstacle
### Slalom 
### U-turns
### Dead ends
### Dynamic enviroments
