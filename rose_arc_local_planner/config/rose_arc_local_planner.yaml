# The cost function used while the arc local planner is in the DRIVE state is defined as follows: 
# ( (distance_w * distance over path) * (clearance_w * (1/minimal_sq_clearance)) ) + (difference_w * difference in radius between two arc's)
# With the 3 measured values individually normalized between 0 and 1.
cost_function_weights:

    # Distance over global path score
    distance: 1.0

    # Clearance towards obstacles score
    clearance: 1.0

    # Arc difference cost
    difference: 1.0
